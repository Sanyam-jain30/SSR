# Abstract: 

Data security is an important term which plays a major role in computers as the 
cyber-crimes are constantly on the rise in today's world. Unauthorized access to 
user's personal data is a major problem of the computer users. In some cases, the 
user will not be able to protect their personal data from being transferred from the 
user's personal device to another device without their knowledge leading to exposure 
of personal data. Besides that, due to these problems the user might not be able to 
identify the person who tries to access into their files or folders which may contains 
the personal data of the user Providing extra security measures for such devices is a 
solution ,We will propose a new security folder application for windows that helps 
the user to secure their folders using strong passwords which keep on changing after 
a specific period (preferably 60 seconds) and maintain the security of user folders. 
Also, the password will be displayed on the user's mobile device using the methods 
like SMTP locally, which also avoids the risk of online cloud attackers.

# Problem Statement: 

As we are very precious regarding security, when it comes to our own system we 
should be secure from both internal and external hackers. The most important is 
protecting from internal attackers as many applications focus on protecting the user 
info from unauthorized external attacks, not the one who uses the user’s system 
behaving as the real user.
Many users, use the common passwords as the system pin (example system, 
password, 1234), by which most of the user’s system will be disclosed to other users 
then in that situation protecting the important files or folders for the attacker is much 
more precious. That's why we came up with this idea.

# List of Objective:

❖ Using SMTP method for sending random password(maxlength=8) to mobile
❖ Password including (capital letter, small letter, digits, special character)
❖ Implementation using C# programming
❖ Implementing window form using Xaml and C# programming

# Novelety of project:

In this project ,we are securing a computer folder using mobile authentication 
password will be displayed in every 60 seconds on the user's mobile device using 
the methods like SMTP locally, which also avoids the risk of online cloud attackers.
As the user is very precious about their data we would like to make a secure system 
that helps the user to store their important data using a strong password and mainly 
locally. If the password comes to the cloud, then it will follow the same series. 
Hence, we will make the user folders/files protected by using auto-generated 
passwords and make security measures.

# Introduction:

Adoption of technology is really excelling. With technology comes the threat to its 
security. These days humans have become much more dependent on electronic 
gadgets while less focusing on its threats and security that comes along with it. Gone 
are the days when one used to write important notes in diaries. These days all the 
important documents are stored in computers electronics. Thus it is very essential to 
secure them. It becomes very difficult to remember these many passwords. Here we 
make a C# windows application which will help to store their sensitive files in an 
encrypted format, where first we make the encrypted folder using C# we generate 
8 digits random Password code, which will be transmitted to our mobile phone using 
SMTP. The user can unlock the folder using the provided password thus providing 
a world legacy encrypted folder for storing any important private files with full trust 
of the end user.

# SMTP:

SMTP or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is an application that is used to send, 
receive, and relay outgoing emails between senders and receivers. When an email is 
sent, it's transferred over the internet from one server to another using SMTP. In 
simple terms, an SMTP email is just an email sent using the SMTP server.

# How it works:

The functioning of an SMTP server can be broken down into two steps:-
❖ The first step includes verification of the computer configuration through 
which an email is sent and granting permission for the process. 
❖ second step, it sends out the message and follows the successful delivery of 
the email.
